#### How It Works:
* Like a hangman game, user will press any key from a to z to guess what the word would be. User will have 15 tries to guess the correct word.


#### How It Is Built: 
* It is built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. It also utilizes Bootstrap framework for responsive page. To test out the algorithm, I first wrote in Python and then port it to JavaScript. I was testing out the differences of the two languages on handling the array or list. There are minor differnces in doing the slicing. It is a neat project to encounter some moments like "I wish this language would have method like this."  The function in both language is pretty much alike. I did not use object (or class) in this project. I did not use jQuery. That would be something to explore in the next project especially for ES6. In Javascript, I used a random generator to generate the guessing word. And the key thing for this project is to use querySelector to push content to the DOM. The project is open to the public and you can see the different check-ins on the progress I was making along the way.
